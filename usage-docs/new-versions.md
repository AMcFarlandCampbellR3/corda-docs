# Adding A New Set of Documentation

There are a few reasons to create a new set of documentation

* A new software version, e.g. Corda Enterprise 123.456
* A new project, e.g. My New Library 1.0

The process largely the same for both.

* You will want to add new [menus](hugo-menus.md).
* You may want to copy existing content
